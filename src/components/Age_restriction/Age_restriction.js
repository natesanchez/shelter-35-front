            The website contains high level coding materials. If you have any

            Sometimes it is hard to speak up in Slack and be seen for not
            knowing something or possibly judged. Here, you can feel freed.
            Shelter 35 is an open space to learn, talk and bond with your cohort
            over anonymous conversation during the SEI 35 experience. PLEASE,
            feel free to complain about work, let out your React anger, and sing
            to the high heavens when your errors suddenly disappear (which won’t
            happen). Here is where you get to do all that without judgement of
            being known for your struggles. Because let’s be honest…the bell
            curves are REAL. Also…we have given you random names and random cat
            pictures for your every post just to add a lil sumthin sumthin.
            Hence…Shelter35.
