# Matt's Readme

**Each member of the group** must participate in the presentation.

Each presentation will be at most ten minutes long. We recommend that you plan
your presentation ahead of time and practice running through it at least once.
Five minutes will then be allotted for questions from the class. Take turns
answering questions during the Q & A. We suggest the following structure:

## Introduction

- What's your app called? Shelter35 We're all cats in this shelter and we need a way to communicate anonomously about our experience in the homeless cat shelter.
- Who are your group members? Who had which responsibilities?
  Nate managed the front end repo and rallied the troops around that effort. He built out a bunch of the smaller components and did a bunch of tidying working that was tedious. His work allowed the remainder of the team to work on big portions of the application.
  Matt managed the back end repo and focused heavily on building that out with guidance and input from the team through his computer. Matt also contributed heavily on the main form.
  Anderson built out the reusable components like the buttons, title input form, and provided significant styling improvements. Anderson built out the blog component and made sure that was fully functional.
  Andrew did a significant amount research on the testing using Jest, and come to find out, that's way more complicated than we originally anticipated. He spent 8 hours just on researching why we couldn't get our tests to work on each others computers and built out some great tests. Andrew also built out a few components like the entry page.
- Why is it useful? What is your "pitch"?

## Demonstrating Your App

- What are the integral features of your app?

## Demonstrating Your Code

- What was the most difficult part?
  - I think an initial issue was building out the blog post creation that required the use of props and state. Neither Matt nor Nate knew how to use props effectively, and that took a few hours to build a functioning component that used other components and managed state and received props from another component.
  - Probably the most complicated portion was the testing. Andrew handled the heavily lifting for the testing, and it took up a BUNCH of his time. We didn't account for this complication early enough, and an learned lesson, is that we should have built our tests along the way, and not after the fact.
- What did you learn?
  - I finally learned React props and state.
  - I learned that we should dial the pace back, don't set as many lofty goals, and focus on the MVP. Once the MVP is done, then build it out from there.
- What are you most proud of?
  - I'm proud of the fact that our front end can do so much, even if it doesn't look attractive.

## The Planning Process

- How did you arrive at this idea?
  - We consolidated two different ideas. Anderson is a cat fan, and there are a decent amount of Cat APIs, we knew we could easily mass on that energy, so we let that drive our idea. We also knew that it should be fun, and somehow we stumbled onto an anonomous posting application that generates random names and avatars for posters. From there, our ideas grew based on the needs of an MVP app.
- How did you decide who would have which responsibilities?
  - We broke these down based on people's strengths. I focused on the back end in the beginning because we knew we could get it up and running quickly. We knew Nate was quite efficient and so we put him in charge of managing the front end repo. From there, we allowed people to tackle problems they were interested in learning because they were weak in it or if we knew we needed to tackle a problem quickly. Andrew jumped on the testing, which was great because he focused heavily on that and learned a bunch. I ended up jumping on the most complicated REACT state/props problem so I could try and learn REACT.
- What would you change about your planning process?
  - Looking back, I wish we were a little slower about starting and planning out our tasks. BUT I'd also say that we didn't know about the things we wish we would change. Honestly I didn't realize how complicated the testing would be. I also didn't anticipate how many little components would be needed to make this fully operational.

## The Workflow

- What Git Workflow did you follow?
  - we followed the centralized workflow. Nate managed a bunch of the repo management for frontend.
- What did you like about this workflow; what did you dislike?
  - I honestly think it went well. The only
- Did you run into any challenges with this workflow? How did you solve them?
  -

## The Week

- What was your week like?
  - The week was spent doing mini-sprints and re-evaluating our position a bunch. Because no one had experiencing managing a team of developers, we had to make frequent stops to make sure our course was true. This was fine because it helped us learn and stay on schedule, but it wasn't efficient.
- Did you feel the Emotional Cycle of Change?
  - It was NOT nearly as dramatic as when we've done projects by ourselves. Because I was apart of a team it was significantly easier to get through a problem and that was really helpful.
- How did you work together?
  - I think we worked well together. We had some minor friction, but it was a learning experience. I think that the group project experience really helped me understand how different the learning experience has been versus how future work will be.

## Highs and Lows

- What worked well?
  - After establishing a rhythm, we could collaborate at a faster pace.
- What didn't?
  - Testing was hard, it was a hard learn, and we had to rely on one person to focus heavily on that to make us successful.
- What features would you like to add?
  - I'd like to see comments on the posts and another Shelter.

## Presentation Schedule

Presentations will take place from 1:30pm - 3:00pm in our classroom.
