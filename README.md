## SHELTER 35

- Our team is made up of Nate, Matt, Anderson and Andrew

- This app was built in React.js and MongoDb

- Take a look and feel free to post! We all have our struggles, so lets talk about it! "put in deployed link"

## ABOUT

- Sometimes it is hard to speak up in Slack and be seen for not knowing something or possibly judged. Here, you dont have that problem. Shelter 35 is an open space to learn, talk and bond with your cohort (anonymously) during the SEI 35 experience. This is a place to complain about work, let out your React anger, and sing to the high heavens when your errors suddenly disappear (which won’t happen). Here is where you get to do all that without judgement of your struggles. To add a little fun and light heartedness to the situations we have given you random names and random cat pictures for your every post just to add a lil sumthin sumthin. Hence…Shelter35.

## VISUAL CHOICES

- Simple, fun and enjoyable pictures as well as blog post containers. Making everything easy to read and perfor.

## INTEGRAL FEATURES

- Full CRUD has to be available to make the site function properly

- The ability to be anonymous is key, otherwise, this is just another Slack

## DIFFICULTIES

- Testing was an issue simply becuase it should have been run from the very beginning. Because of this, it is easy to see what features and possibly components could have been made more DRY or not been used at all.

- Fulfilling full CRUD was a difficulty because of the routing that needs to be done as well as the clean functionality when a feature is induced

- Debugging some CSS when merging conflicts came about was not necessarily an issue for our group, though it is easy to see how miscommunication or imporper merging could throw everything to a hault

## LEARNING AND ACCOMPLISHMENTS

- Working as a team added some comfort and attitude boost because not one person felt "alone" with an issue or bug they came accross. This took learning to communicate the right way and make sure the team was "all in" together on a lot of decisions. It seems we are all quite happy with the result and have some pride with it

- The app functions as we had dreampt it at the start. Seeing this product as it is now is humbling. It took the team to get it done in the alloted time and maybe next time we can built something faster, better and run at high volumes.

## ROADMAP / FUTURE FEATURES

- Feature wise, as a team we are happy with what we have done. On launching though there is a some delay to performance based on volume. Re-assessment to performance and refracting is needed to make the site running seamlessly. Going forward, proper testing and component structuring should help with this before launching.
